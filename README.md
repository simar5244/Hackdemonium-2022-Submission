Description: The program feeds the surveillance camera footage and distinguishes normal human actions like walking, running to abnormal actions like fighting. In case of an abnormal action, it can trigger an alarm, report to police services, and/or call emergency health services, eliminating the need for security personell to keep watching boring surveillance videos all the time.
